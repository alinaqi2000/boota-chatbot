# Boota Chatbot

Boota is a simple yet powerful chatbot that uses Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. The chatbot is designed to receive prompts and search for possible responses within conversations stored in text files. Whether you're looking to add a conversational interface to your application or just want to explore the world of chatbots, Boota is a great starting point.

## Features

- **Flask Backend**: The backend of Boota is powered by Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. It efficiently handles incoming prompts and searches for responses within the stored conversations.

- **React Frontend**: Boota's frontend is built with React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. Users can easily interact with the chatbot and view the responses in real-time.

- **Conversation Storage**: Conversations are stored in text files, allowing for easy customization and expansion of the chatbot's knowledge base. You can modify or extend the conversations to tailor Boota to your specific use case.
